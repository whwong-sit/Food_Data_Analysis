Food Data Analysis
==================

This repository contains copies of publically available data on food and
any derivative datasets or analyses for use in a series of Community
Data Wrangling Events to be run by Simon Cropper.

Only data released under an open license that allows creation of
comparable derivatives will be stored in this repository. Please read
the license details associated with each dataset that is stored in the
root directory -- take particular care in reviewing any license terms,
like disclaimers, specified by the database creators/custodians.

The original downloaded datasets will be stored for each dataset in a
read only directory. Derivative datasets or format shifts will be stored
in distinct directories.

Subsequent wrangling, mining or analysis will be comparmentalised and
will be treated as distinct projects.

Only work using free and open source tools with full disclosure on the
methods employed will be published on this repo. This is to help others
to learn and understand how the data has been manipulated.

People interested in participating in various stages of the analysis
can watch or clone the repo or add their names to the participant
list that will be posted under each event.
